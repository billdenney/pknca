# Introduction

PKNCA considers two types of data grouping within data sets:  the group and the interval.  A group typically identifies a single subject given a single intervention type (a "treatment") with a single analyte.  An interval subsets a group by times within the group, and primary noncompartmental analysis (NCA) calculations are performed within an interval.

As a concrete example, consider the figure below shows the concentration-time profile of a study subject in a multiple-dose study.  The group is all points in the figure, and the interval is the area with blue shading.

```{r plotgroupinterval, echo=FALSE}
