PKNCAdose(data, ...)

\method{PKNCAdose}{default}(data, ...)

\method{PKNCAdose}{tbl_df}(data, ...)

\method{PKNCAdose}{data.frame}(data, formula, route, rate, duration, labels,
  units, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with time and the groups defined in 
\code{formula}.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

\item{formula}{The formula defining the 
\code{dose.amount~time|groups} where \code{time} is the time of the
dosing and \code{dose.amount} is the amount administered at that 
time (see Details).}

\item{route}{Define the route of administration.  The value may be 
either a column name from the \code{data} (checked first) or a 
character string of either \code{"extravascular"} or 
\code{"intravascular"} (checked second).  If given as a column 
name, then every value of the column must be either 
\code{"extravascular"} or \code{"intravascular"}.}

\item{rate, duration}{(optional) for \code{"intravascular"} dosing, 
the rate or duration of dosing.  If given as a character string, it
is the name of a column from the \code{data}, and if given as a 
number, it is the value for all doses.  Only one may be given, and 
if neither is given, then the dose is assumed to be a bolus 
(\code{duration=0}).  If \code{rate} is given, then the dose amount
must be given (the left hand side of the \code{formula}).}

\item{labels}{(optional) Labels for use when plotting.  They are a 
named list where the names correspond to the names in the data 
frame and the values are used for xlab and/or ylab as appropriate.}

\item{units}{(optional) Units for use when plotting and calculating 
parameters.  Note that unit conversions and simplifications are not
done; the text is used as-is.}
}
\value{
A PKNCAconc object that can be used for automated NCA.

\description{
Create a PKNCAdose object
}
\details{
The \code{formula} for a \code{PKNCAdose} object can be 
  given three ways: one-sided (missing left side), one-sided (missing
  right side), or two-sided.  Each of the three ways can be given 
  with or without groups.  When given one-sided missing the left 
  side, the left side can either be omitted or can be given as a 
  period (\code{.}): \code{~time|treatment+subject} and 
  \code{.~time|treatment+subject} are identical, and dose-related NCA
  parameters will all be reported as not calculable (for example, 
  clearance).  When given one-sided missing the right side, the right
  side must be specified as a period (\code{.}): 
  \code{dose~.|treatment+subject}, and only a single row may be given
  per group.  When the right side is missing, PKNCA assumes that the 
  same dose is given in every interval.  When given as a two-sided 
  formula
